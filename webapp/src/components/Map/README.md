# Map

An interactive Earth rendered using Three.js (WebGL). It provides an interface to draw rasters, points, paths, and other vector geometries using georeferenced data (lat, lng). 

This graphical component is used when we want to present data that is geographical in nature. The aim is to help readers understand where they are, and where things are in relationship to each other.
